### Work Experience

#### Associate Data Scientist
###### Commonwealth Bank of Australia (March 2018 - Present)
My personal achievements at this role:
- Project management and delivery lead for the bank's first modelling feature store built on our big data platform, using spark ETL pipeline loading daily and will grow to hold over 1,000 customer attributes that can be directly consumed by autoML tools for data science and modelling teams across the bank for various modelling projects
- Deployment and optimisation of a large-scale automated machine learning modelling framework that continuously re-calibrate in real time through customer interactions with over 2 million data points utilised per day across multiple channels on a Next-Best-Action platform. The models are productionised in our Customer Engagement Engine to tailor fit banking products and reward programmes to over 30 million customers. Over 2,100 models were built within days in parallel with comparable performance to models handcrafted by our data scientists that on average take 3 months to build per model.
- Development of adaptive model monitoring framework with capability to dynamically monitor all our models with historical view on model performance and their impact to business. The framework is fully automated and scheduled to run periodically with streamlined processes to scrape data from multiple data sources, provide reporting on model-level and product-level in real-time with capability to auto-recommend actions for model calibration and alignment.
- Development of model value calculation methodology which enables the team to calculate the actual incremental value (over $37M in FY19) driven by our models for the very first time and helping the business build confidence and to continue increase strategic investments by $2M in FY19 to grow the data science capabilities in CBA.
- Lead in development of a series of personalisation capabilities for Australia's no. 1 banking App and NetBank, including personalization of messaging, collaterals and impression capping to boost click-rates and sales.
