## About Me

I am an experienced data scientist with 6 years of experience working across multiple industries including health, higher education, marketing and banking sectors. My journey of data science began when I was a medical research student, where I enjoyed a highly successful 3-year stint as a master and PhD candidate contributing to the fields of microbiology, immunology and genomics with 5 publications amassing thousands of views and citations of my work by research publications and medical textbooks across the globe. During which time, I also supported trans-continental epidemiology studies of various hepatic diseases and clinical trials of novel medicine in Concord Hospital with my exceptional data analytics skills which enabled me to stand out from the rest of my peers in the field.

With the above achievements, I successfully attained scholarships to support my PhD studies where my thesis was focused on developing neural network capabilities to analyse bacterial and viral genomes. However, I soon realised the potential machine learning and AI had across multiple industries and along with other personal reasons, decided to head into industry to work as a data scientist.

Today I am a data scientist in Australia's largest financial institute and have worked on multiple high profile projects including:
- Lead in development and optimisation of the bank's first adaptive modelling framework with a complementary monitoring capability which saved over 37 years of data scientist time to build 200+ predictive models manually and drove an incremental uplift of ~$40M AUD in FY2019
- Lead in development of a series of personalisation capabilities for Australia's no. 1 banking app
- Lead in development and delivery of the bank's next-gen modelling feature store on our hadoop platform
- Lead in research and application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

I have received a number of recognitions for the success of the above projects.
- Winner of 2019 CBA Data Science Award
- Winner of 2020 Celent Model Bank Award for Customer Engagement
- Nominated for 2019 WHICH-50 Best in Automation

I am very grateful to have had opportunities to not only have worked in multiple industries but also across the spectrum of data science work spanning over data engineering, developing modelling tools, predictive modelling, insight analytics and more. As a result I am proficient in a range languages, tools and platforms including:
- R, Python, SQL (MS SQL, Teradata, Oracle, Hive), YAML
- Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Raspbian), Git, Bash
- Machine learning (Supervised, Unsupervised), Neural Networks
- Tableau, PowerBI

Currently I am developing skills in the following:
- C/C++
- AWS, GCP
- Python Django (web development)
- Neural Networks

### Work Experience

#### Associate Data Scientist
##### Commonwealth Bank of Australia (March 2018 - Present)
My personal achievements at this role:
- Project management and delivery lead for the bank's first modelling feature store built on our big data platform, using spark ETL pipeline loading daily and will grow to hold over 1,000 customer attributes that can be directly consumed by autoML tools for data science and modelling teams across the bank for various modelling projects
- Deployment and optimisation of a large-scale automated machine learning modelling framework that continuously re-calibrate in real time through customer interactions with over 2 million data points utilised per day across multiple channels on a Next-Best-Action platform. The models are productionised in our Customer Engagement Engine to tailor fit banking products and reward programmes to over 30 million customers. Over 2,100 models were built within days in parallel with comparable performance to models handcrafted by our data scientists that on average take 3 months to build per model.
- Development of adaptive model monitoring framework with capability to dynamically monitor all our models with historical view on model performance and their impact to business. The framework is fully automated and scheduled to run periodically with streamlined processes to scrape data from multiple data sources, provide reporting on model-level and product-level in real-time with capability to auto-recommend actions for model calibration and alignment.
- Development of model value calculation methodology which enables the team to calculate the actual incremental value (over $37M in FY19) driven by our models for the very first time and helping the business build confidence and to continue increase strategic investments by $2M in FY19 to grow the data science capabilities in CBA.
- Lead in development of a series of personalisation capabilities for Australia's no. 1 banking App and NetBank, including personalization of messaging, collaterals and impression capping to boost click-rates and sales.
